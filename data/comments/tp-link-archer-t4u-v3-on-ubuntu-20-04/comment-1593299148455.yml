comment: "Hello, thank you for the steps! They helped, I can now select a network from the UI. But what I can't really complete is authenticate. I've tried other drivers with no luck.\r\n\r\nIt keeps asking for a password that I know is right, because is used in many other devices. I wonder if you want into something similar. \r\n\r\nThanks"
